Balaji’s Die Game is a simple interactive web application built using React and deployed on Vercel, designed to demonstrate core front-end development concepts through a dice-style game. 

The project uses React functional components and hooks (such as useState) to manage game state, generate random dice values, and update the user interface dynamically based on user interactions like clicking to roll the dice. 

It showcases essential React features including component-based architecture, event handling, conditional rendering, and basic CSS styling for a clean and responsive UI. Overall, this project serves as a beginner-friendly React game that highlights practical learning in state management, JavaScript logic, and real-world deployment.
